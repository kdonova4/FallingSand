# Falling Sand with Raylib In a Week
I remembered playing with something like this in middle school and wanted to see if I could recreate that in C with raylib. Its just a starting point and something I think I will come back to and add more types of pixels. For now it is just SAND, WATER, STONE.

STONE - a static block that is a barrier.

WATER - flows left and right when possible.

SAND - will flow down and to the left or right when possible, creates pyramids.
